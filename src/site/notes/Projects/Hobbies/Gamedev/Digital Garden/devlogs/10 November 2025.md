It turns out that making games isn't the only hard part; finishing projects is just as important, and just as difficult.
<div style="height: 50px;"></div>
If last devlog was any indication: I am not good at finishing projects. Perhaps it's my ADHD or just the dopamine rush of a clean slate and nothing weighing you down as you tread new ground. Either way, it's not something that comes easy for me when making games.

I started really focusing on games in February of last year, 2024. That's almost two years ago as of this writing. I have, on a quick mental tally that may or not be accurate, had 8 false start projects since then -- and one single game jam release (with only 3 levels). 

That's a piss poor track record, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel pretty bad about it. I **want** to finish things, I **want** to see my ideas come to fruition, but often times my ideas hold too much weight for my experience to bear. It's as if I have a tea cup's capacity for development and my ideas always seem to swell to the volume of an Olympic-sized swimming pool.
