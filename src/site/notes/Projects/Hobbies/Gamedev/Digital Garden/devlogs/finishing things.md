10-Nov-2025 - "finishing things"

---
It turns out that making games isn't the only hard part; finishing projects is just as important, and just as difficult.
<div style="height: 50px;"></div>
If last devlog was any indication: I am not good at finishing projects. Perhaps it's my ADHD or just the dopamine rush of a clean slate and nothing weighing me down as I tread new ground. Either way, it's not something that comes easy for me when making games.

I started really focusing on games in February of last year, 2024. That's almost two years ago as of this writing. I have (on a quick mental tally that may or not be accurate) had 8 false start projects since then -- ***and only one single game jam release (with only 3 levels).*** 

That's a piss poor track record, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel pretty bad about it. I **want** to finish things, I **want** to see my ideas come to fruition, but often times my ideas hold too much weight for my experience to bear. It's as if I have a tea cup's capacity for development and my ideas always seem to swell to the volume of an Olympic-sized swimming pool. 

Now, if this resonates at all with you reading this: take heart -- it is not a bad thing. Indeed, to be overflowing with ideas that inspire you to no end is perhaps one of the most valuable traits you can have when making games. The more experience you gain, the more of these ideas you can breathe life into. However, I know all too well how difficult it is to reign in this beast of inspiration; it can just as easily be a curse to meaningful, forward progress.

##### So, how do we finish things?
I believe I've made it abundantly clear that I'm still figuring this out. I hope that in reading these devlogs you may pick up some useful tips and tricks to help you finish games.

## 1. Starting small

I was always so annoyed hearing this, and it was easy to keep scrolling to the next piece of advice -- but it is ubiquitous for a reason. It is the **antithesis** of Olympic-sized swimming pool ideas; a very affront to my huge, genius game plans. But that's precisely the point.

##### Easier said than done
How do we find small ideas, and keep the scope small throughout the project? [Game Maker's Tool Kit](https://gmtk.substack.com/p/how-to-find-amazing-game-ideas) has a great article on how to find great game ideas. The reason I bring up this article is because Mark discusses finding the **core idea**, and ruthlessly trimming the fat until you get there. I think, furthermore, that great ideas are rarely made on paper first. 

Starting small means taking what may be a grand, huge project, and cutting it down to bare metal. What are the core mechanics? What makes it fun? What is the interaction the player would be doing? 

###### Starting small does not mean "be less ambitious", but instead "find the heart of the idea before you get swept away in fantasy". 

Once you have the core idea, that's when you can go crazy through iteration and testing. It's easy to hand-wave features in your head; it's another thing to implement, adjust, and pivot. That is the substrate where games are made -- not in your brain!
