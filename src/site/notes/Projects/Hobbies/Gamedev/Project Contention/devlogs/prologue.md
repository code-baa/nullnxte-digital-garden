Making games is hard.  It encompasses many different disciplines that are each careers in their own right.
<div style="height: 50px;"></div>
In game development you're a designer, a programmer, an animator, a modeler, a composer, a sound designer -- and, I'm afraid, this list is just the tip of the iceberg. 

No surprise, then, that someone interested in game development might see this workload and decide to turn around. I've dropped and picked up 'game dev' too many times to count. Maybe I found it overwhelming, or maybe I was just following the whim of my interests. Either way, I've amassed a wasteland of unfinished projects on my hard drives: tech demos, environmental demos, random little simulations -- they pepper my project folders like the barnacles on a boat heading nowhere. But looking back, each abandoned project taught me something new, and a vector of progress seems to appear from the chaos.

My first foray into 'game development' was making maps in Hammer for CounterStrike: Source. I picked up GameMaker 8, and over the course of 10 years I moved from engine to engine. GameMaker Studio, GameMaker Studio 2, Unity, and finally Godot. I was always making music and visual art during this time, and I'd pick up each interest whenever I felt the inspiration to dive in. It would seem I've been in 'game development boot camp' without entirely being aware of it.

### A window to the wasteland

### Looking forward
Last year I decided to pick up Godot and try to learn every part of it -- to really take a crack at learning, prototyping, and understanding as much as I can. I haven't looked back. I wanted to commit myself to finishing things, and start releasing the projects I started. If you're a creative of any discipline, you certainly know the struggle. 

I did my first game jam this year and released a short demo of a game called Flywheel. It was a small win on it's face, but the reality is that it took me (only) 10 years to 'finish' something; to present a project in a playable state with actual game design implemented. It felt immensely rewarding to see people play something I made and actually get stumped on a puzzle. It certainly gave me the confidence to know I could do something bigger. And if you're going to go big, why hold back?

Four failed-starts later and I'm working on that 'something big'. It might look terrible, it might not be fun, it may be total crap, but I'm going to finish and release it. I'll be documenting the journey on here, to no particular audience. 

If you do happen to be reading this, welcome in. I hope you enjoyed the whirlwind tour of my progress up until this point. Come along for the ride and let's see where this barnacle-ridden boat takes us.
